Welcome to Artifact's documentation. 

I have divided this documentation into distinct, digestable components. I recommend you get started with a quick <em><a href=''>Introduction</a></em> and then delve into <em><a href=''>Installing the Relic</a></em>. If your blood has not already been frozen from the realization of the awesome grandeur of the cosmic cycles wherein Artifact dwells, you may peer into a cryptic tome describing the internals.
<br><br>
The inscriptions of technical documentation contains herein may open up such vast and terrifying vistas of reality that your frightful position therein will be revealed, certainly causing you to go mad from the revelation. By continuing to read further, you are exempting the author of any existential liability.

<p>
Artifact is a highly performant, scalable distributed key-value store system, based on Amazon's Dynamo database model. 

It's open source and abhorrently available. Unstructured and permissive in what it accepts, strict in what it delivers -- perfect for storing instantaneously accessible session information, massive datasets and deep analytics. 
<br>
Artifact is currently commercially used by <a href='http://mixrank.com/'>MixRank</a> and <a href='http://primerlabs.com/'>Primer Labs</a> to deliver wickedly fast record retrieval without write locks.
