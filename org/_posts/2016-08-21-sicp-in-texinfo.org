SICP's availability has allowed for reworking it's text for contemporary
audiences. A notable piece of kit that's come light years since the 80s is Emacs
which today regarded as the best environment for doing SICP and programming
Scheme.

Emacs offers an extremely in-depth (if esoteric) help system using the document
format Texinfo. Installing texinfo documents is simple but the provided
documentation inexplicably leaves out critical steps. Here's what I did to get
it working

1. [[http://www.neilvandyke.org/sicp-texi/sicp.info.gz][Download a /.texi/ copy of SICP]] 
3. =$ mv =(unzip sicp.info.gz) /usr/local/share/info=
2. =$ install-info ~/Downloads/sicp.info.gz=
