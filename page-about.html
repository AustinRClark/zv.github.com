<h3>Plot Synopsis</h3>

<p>Set in the near future, <i>A New Kind of Sentience</i> follows the exploits of Zephyr Pellerin, a hermit who lives an isolated existence in a fortified New Mexico desert hideaway - an exile from the human community.</p>

<p>Following a call from his irate roomate demanding the last two modules per his publishing deal, Zephyr packs his belongings and descends the mountains before traveling to the classic city of iniquity - San Francisco; a twisted amalgam of pervasive consumerism, sex, violence, drugs and the homeless - some kind of prototypical liberal suburbia, self-centered and focused almost exclusively on present-day matters, beggars and the architects of the future living side by side. Two sides of the same coin really, beggars looking for the next charitable passerby so they may live another day, startups looking for the next greedy tycoon to give birth to their idealized electronic empire</p>

<p>Since his mysterious disappearance to the wild lands, he now speaks for the arcane sciences of mathematics and the abstract smoke of artificial cognition, and to the dismay and utter confusion the intelligensia, seemingly rules his own quiet corner of  the net (through his mastery of all things technological of course :) with his radical rhetoric. He addresses the disenfranchised citizens of the bay and beyond, acknowledging their disappointment in the "future" they live in while everyone is listening and watching closely as we all herald a new digital prophet, the final technology, the one shard of hope everyone is looking for to save us from ourselves: </p>

<p>A new kind of sentience.</p>
