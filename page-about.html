Set in the near future, a new kind of sentience follows the exploits of Zephyr Pellerin, a purportedly mad mathematician and hermit lives an isolated existence in a fortified desert hideaway - an exile from the human community. Following a call from his irate roomate demanding the last two modules per his publishing deal, Zephyr packs his belongings and descends the mountains before traveling back to the city of San Francisco - a twisted amalgam of pervasive consumerism, sex, violence and drugs; albeit highly liberal, self-centered and focused almost exclusively on present-day matters. Zephyr Pellerin reinvents himself - addressing the disenfranchised citizens of the 'net, radically acknowleding their disappointement in the 'future' they live in, the impending dissolution of the barriers between of the digital and physical reality and lastly, but certainly not least, the coming of the 'real' end times - the final human technology ..
