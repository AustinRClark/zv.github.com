<h3>Plot Synopsis</h3>

<p>Set in the near future, <i>A New Kind of Sentience</i> follows the bizarre exploits of Zephyr Pellerin, who lives a quiet existence in a fortified mountain hideaway - an programmatic exile from the human community.</p>

<p>Following an email from his friends demanding his return for one last shot at fortune and fame, Zephyr packs his belongings before traveling to the impossibly nouveau-riche city of iniquity -- San Francisco; a twisted amalgam of pervasive sex, violence, drugs and the homeless. Undoubtedly one of God's prototype cities --  high tech liberal Mecca of technology, focused almost entirely on present day matters, never even remotely considered for mass production, but just insane enough to save condemning the whole thing for
the foreseeable future.</p>

<p>Now, he addresses the disenfranchised and alienated citizens of the Bay and beyond, acknowledging their deep disappointment in the 'future' they live in, terrified of a world slipping deeper into irreconcilible catastrophe. Now, everyone is listening and watching closely as we herald a new digital prophet: the thinking machines -- the final technology -- the last shard of hope that everyone is looking to to save us from ourselves...</p>
