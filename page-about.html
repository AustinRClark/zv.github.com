<h3>Plot Synopsis</h3>

<p>Set in the near future, <i>A New Kind of Sentience</i> follows the exploits of Zephyr Pellerin, a hermit who lives an isolated existence in a fortified New Mexico desert hideaway - an exile from the human community.</p>

<p>Following a call from his irate roomate demanding the last two modules per his publishing deal, Zephyr packs his belongings and descends the mountains before traveling to the classic city of iniquity - San Francisco; a twisted amalgam of pervasive consumerism, sex, violence, drugs and the homeless. One of God's own prototype cities - A high powered liberal mutant Mecca of technology never even considered for mass production. Too wierd to cast damnation upon, yet to rare to die out.</p>

<p>Now, he addresses the wannabe disenfranchised citizens of the bay and beyond, acknowledging their deep disappointment in the "future" they live in, but to remind them that for every moment of great human triumph, for every instance of some post-modern yuppie fantasy device that is revealed upon a market waiting with bated breath, that a million souls must be trampled to deliver your clean aluminum exterior - a hopeless reach into our postmodern and relativistic shared cultural hegemony. Zephyr Pellerin tackles the simple problems while the frightening prospects of a world running out of options short of malthusian collapse - while everyone is listening and watching closely as we all herald a new digital prophet, the final technology, the one shard of hope everyone is looking from our own creation:</p>

<p>A new kind of sentience.</p>
