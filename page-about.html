<h3>Plot Synopsis</h3>

<p>Set in the near future, <i>A New Kind of Sentience</i> follows the bizarre exploits of Zephyr Pellerin, who lives an isolated existence in a fortified mountain hideaway - an exile from the human community.</p>

<p>Following a call from his irate manager demanding the last two modules per his publishing deal, Zephyr packs his belongings and descends the mountains before traveling to the classic city of iniquity -- San Francisco; a twisted amalgam of pervasive consumerism, sex, violence, drugs and the destitute homeless. One of God's prototype cities - A high powered liberal mutant Mecca of technology never even remotely considered for mass production, but too wierd let perish in a fiery
apocalypse.</p>

<p>Now, he addresses the disenfranchised and alienated citizens of the Bay and beyond, acknowledging their deep disappointment in the 'future' they live in, terrified of a world slipping deeper into irreconcilible catastrophe. Now, everyone is listening and watching closely as he heralds a new digital prophet: the thinking machines -- the so called final technology -- the last shard of hope that everyone is looking to to save us from ourselves...</p>
