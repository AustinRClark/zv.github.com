<h3>Plot Synopsis</h3>

<p>Set in the near future, <i>A New Kind of Sentience</i> follows the exploits of Zephyr Pellerin, an enigmatic computer scientist who lives an isolated existence in a fortified New Mexico desert hideaway - an exile from the human community.</p>

<p>Following a call from his irate manager demanding the last two modules per his publishing deal, Zephyr packs his belongings and descends the mountains before traveling to the classic city of iniquity -- San Francisco; a twisted amalgam of pervasive consumerism, sex, violence, drugs and the homeless. One of God's own prototype cities - A high powered liberal mutant Mecca of technology never even considered for mass production. Too wierd to cast damnation upon, yet to rare to die out.</p>

<p>Now, he addresses the disenfranchised and alienated citizens of the Bay and beyond, acknowledging their deep disappointment in the 'future' they live in, terrified of a world slipping deeper into irreconcilible catastrophe. So now, everyone is listening and watching closely as we herald a new digital prophet -- the so called final technology -- the last shard of hope that everyone is looking to to save us from ourselves:</p>
