<h1>The Principles of Artifact<a class="headerlink" href="#foreword" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>This is an introductory document to get you comfortable with the technical principles of Artifact, it's purposes and goals, and it's ideal (and non-ideal)
use cases.</p>
<div class="section" id="what-does-micro-mean">
<h2>Why Artifact?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-does-micro-mean" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Reliability and speed at scale is one of the largest challenges I've faced. Slow performance periods and outages have major financial consequences and impacts both
trust in a technical team and your teams's faith in the business. We provide millions of records, implemented on top of servers and network components
that, at sufficient scale, effectively fail continously. It became distinctly apparent early on that handling failure while remaining fast is integral.</p>
<p>One of the things I've learned from Scott Miliken and the rest of the team is that the design of managing a datastore's state is critical. MixRank is built on top of decentralized, loosely coupled
interacting services consisting of hundreds of concurrent indexing operations. Therefore, Artifact is constructed in such a fashion that failure is a given,
and recovery should be guaranteed.</p>
<p>Consequently, Artifact is constructed to be optimal for modern hardware, built upon well known techniques in mathematics and computer science to achieve
scalability, speed and rapid query infrastructure. Virtually all services built today require only primary keys as the driving query mechanism: Artifact provides
a simple interface to facilitate this. Artifact synthesizes a new kind of database by combining existing well known and obscure techniques. Storage nodes can be added or removed without any kind of manual repartitioning
of data, and redistribution is entirely automatic. Artifact is eventually consistent, and the durability of data is ensured by classic techniques like Byzantine 
Quorum technique with rapid synchronization across nodes. Data is automatically divided and distributed according to well known consistent hashing methods.
Failure detection is based on vector clock desyncs detected through Gossip protocols. Additionally, Artifact is completely decentralized and has been designed
with the express purpose of <em>"not being a pain in the ass"</em>.

<h2>When Artifact is Dangerous<a class="headerlink" href="#web-development-is-dangerous">¶</a></h2>
<p>For over a decade, many prophets have voiced the contention that the organization of a single relational database has reached it's limits and that truely signifigant
advancements can only be made through the interconnection of a multiplicity of disparate interacting nonrelational systems.</p><p> This is of course very untrue, <a href='http://www.postgresql.org/'>PostGreSQL</a> and Oracle lie
at the core of many of the Web's greatest enterprises, and through sheer will, many technically advanced solutions have been implemented to continue the development of sharded relational systems. If you are looking for (arguably pedantic) ACID compliance, look away, because Artifact will not give you what you're looking for. Artifact is eventually consistent with (rare, but possible) discrepencies between node convergence, Artifact is interested in writing data and is not interested in pitching you a redundant journaling system. To be frank, I think filesystems have cornered the market in this regard and it would be very disrespectful of me to try to sell you on a write-ahead log or redundant journaling system that pales in comparison to the considerable work that has gone into making filesystems virtually indestructable today.</p>
