<div class="txt">
<p>RedForth was derived from another, early attempt to create a forth stack machine,
at one point I even had some pretensions about getting this junker to support p-adic
integer expansion. An interesting derivation of this, original intent notwithstanding,
is the interestingly elegant  proof of why mathematicians shouldn't 
bother with language design</p>
