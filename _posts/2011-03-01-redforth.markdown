<p>RedForth was derived from another, early attempt to create a Forth stack machine,
at one point I even had some pretensions about getting this junker to support p-adic
integer expansion.</p>

<p>An interesting derivation of this, original intent notwithstanding,
is an elegant  proof of why mathematicians shouldn't 
bother with programming language design</p>
