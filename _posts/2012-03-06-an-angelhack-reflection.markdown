<div class=txt>


<p>This weekend me and some fellow hackers did some much needed freehacking at AngelHack, we
produced a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4pgP7IPOqs">new facial
recognition application called 'SavingFace'</a> from scratch in about 24 hours and won in San Francisco (the hackathon was split into Boston and San Francisco regions). We came for the prizes (specifically the new Intel AppUp laptops) and met some very interesting people. The whole thing left me with the feeling of deep, existential dread about the nature of funding and hackers in general in the valley after the event.</p>

<p>Our actual hacking was exceptionally fun (though uneventful), but we did notice a distinct lack of, well, hacking (at a hackathon).</p>
<p>Lots of people talking about hacking, lots of people talking about popular web technologies, but very little actual hacking. For that matter, everyone else in the building seemed equally incredulous at the number of "hustlers" vs "hackers", like the whole hackathon was some sort ofbizzare trick at their expense.</p>
<p>When the time came to submit our applications, the whole angelhack submission process broke. We sent text messages to try to get our app in. We accidentally XSSed the self-crafted angelhack chat bar which caused some rucus and lame copycat attacks, we were in some sort of bizzaro-world real life IRC channel.</p>
<p>After some delays, when those who were nominated to participate were called out, we noticed that our group's name "Lambda Herders" was conspiciously absent.</p>
<p>
As the groups prepared to speak, we stood dejected as the intentionally comedic "Download4Me" graced the stage. In that moment I wondered if the world even cared, if the years of linear algebra, stochastic calculus and collected computer science we had accrued were totally meaningless. Maybe I really was the sucker here, maybe book learning was just for squares who hadn't yet figured out the mechanics of life? Who was I to judge though? I'm just a programmer on a small blue planet in some disconsolate corner of the long arm of the galaxy. Feeling just a bit sad, Just as we were about to leave the building, the loadspeakers blared "Lumbda, uhhh, Lambduh Harders?"
</p>
<p>
What? Did you seriously nominate us but forget to tell us? (fairness, this was quite a chaotic event)
</p>
<p>We all scrambled to pull ourselves together, living in the moment the strange pretense that somehow the results of this hackathon actually meant something. <p>

<p>I'm lucky enough to know good people, actually, I take that back, I know fucking geniuses. With absolutely no preparation Steven and Mek launched into the various modalities of this application, the potential and the existing technology. After apps to show you cat pictures and download a link to your dropbox, The angel investor judge panel was very impressed.</p>

<p>Without missing a beat, after our presentation, a young "journalist" (whatever that designation may imply) ran up to me after our presentation
and asked me how I came to this station in life (As flattering at these questions
are, I still sincerely hope that minor renown at poorly attended Angel investor 
event is not the extent of my success).</p>

<p>I deliberated for a moment on how to answer and said this -- "If I had the
best Hacker News and Reddit articles and the greatest video games every single
day for 100 years, it's still doesn't come close in comparison to the feeling
of doing things that I think matter. Creating things that matter -- breathing
life into the soul of a new kind of machine. That is what consumes me, so
that's what I always have and always will pursue"</p>
<p>She paused, seemingly surprised, she stared into my eyes with a look that
appeared to straddle the uncomfortable region between concern and fear.</p>
<p>These overly serious answers are a weakness of mine. In my defense, I didn't think these sort of answers would be unusual at a "hacker" event.</p>
<p>A few really skilled people come up onto the stage and pitch their demos, a few not so skilled people do as well (it shows). I've never believed in the whole "great programmers do 100x what good programmers do" until now.</p>
<p>A older, well meaning health startup entrepreneur pitches his idea for a stress meter to the judges, yelling at them to show how quickly stress can change.</p>
<p>After a long pause, the prospective wantrepreneur continued on with his web 2.0 
health app pitch. Dave McClure was not happy, and beginning to show it.
</p>
<p>Mid pitch, like a scene from Mulholland Drive , McClure launches into a (possibly drug addled) fury. "I'm NOT YOUR FUCKING DEMO, DON'T DEMO ME BRO!"
is yelled at ear piercing intensity. Dave leaves the judging panel never to 
return. We're all fucking stunned, completely silenced, everyone on edge a little
more than nessasary. Our clever entrepreneur starts pleading "Come back, Dave, come
back". </p>

<p>Dave's not coming back, Dave's not even in the building anymore. Dave is fucking
gone. </p>

<p>You kindof have to wonder if a smart guy like Dave had this all planned out -- a 21st century genius socialite who just verged a little too close to madness and profited at our expense. Dave, you're either crazy or a genius or both.</p>

<p>
The judging panel moves on -- nothing surprises the valley intelligensia
anymore. I'm sure to them this is another day in the place they call home. Maybe some
kind of deep subtextual exchange just occurred there. I don't know, I'm plead youth and ignorance. I'm not one to invoke a diety's presence in these kind of circumstances but please god just let me win these laptops and get out of here.</p> 

<p>The judging spontaneously ends and wraps up, sans Dave. When all is said and done we've won some great stuff, and thankfully we won those laptops from Intel.</p>

<p>Trying to exit the building without being mobbed by 3rd tier "me too" investors is a surprising challenge. I knew this was the epicenter of the bubble (if there is one) and I just wanted to leave, I was sick.</p>

<p>
"Hey my friend, can I call you my friend?". Sure thing, <i>comrade</i>. "I'm in Business Development, me and my partner really like what you're doing, you guys
are obviously geniuses and are sitting on a tech goldmine, you guys could get acquihired 
by facebook before the IPO-- call me when you want to start a company"
</p>

<p>
I'm polite enough to take his card with feigned interest.
</p>

<p>The sun is starting to set over the Adobe Headquarters. We walk back to the "hackerhauz" -- a sort of twisted amalgam of a anarchistic squat cum research laboratory. 
Perhaps it was the sleep deprivation, maybe the raw terror of the whole event, maybe we knew the era of free money and easy respect for hackers was about to end, but for the first time in a long time, for the entire walk home, we're all silent.</p>
