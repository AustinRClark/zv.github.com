<p id="text">My first mark on the world. When I was 14 I implemented
a WEP cracker in C++ using patched  WUSB54GS drivers with the newfound
method of ARP packet reinjection (with h1kar1's excellent chop-chop wep package),
and the classic WEP rc4 vulnerability - FMS, recieving the enthusiastic applause of...
a small number of largely japanese fans. Surprisingly, it lives on despite the 
presence of considerably more advanced tools like aircrack. A rustic relic, 
documenting the strange practices of of software written by a younger version
of myself, like some kind of parallax timewave to 2006!</p>
