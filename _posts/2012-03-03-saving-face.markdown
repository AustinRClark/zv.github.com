<p>Turns out, me and my totally bitchin' (sorry for the course language, but sometimes "rad" will not suffice) roomates Mek <i>"Guitar Man"</i> Karpeles and Stephen <i>"Brain Man"</i> Balaban can totally hack the planet</p> 

<p>We participated in the eminent & world-renowned (may be strecthing here) hackathon - Angelhack. We hacked on a facial recognition app implementing our own detection algorithm and the excellent recognition backend <a href="http://www.face.com">Face.com</a> to produce a project for automatically recognizing friends and pulling up their facebook information, just from a picture! All in less than 30 hours! </p>

<p>After the event's judging, we won the San Francisco division! This won us our current laptop and literally 500(!) dollars of <a href="http://www.heroku">Heroku</a> credit.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.firstpost.com/topic/organization/intel-augmented-reality-ar-glasses-app-saving-face-video-F4pgP7IPOqs-830-10.html">I was designated by a reporter at the event to be "last of the freelance hackers"</a>, That's what it says. (Caution, Shark Jumps ahead: My fame and aristocracy has already started to give me a false sense that this somehow means I'm important! )</p>
