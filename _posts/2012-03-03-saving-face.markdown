<p>Me and Mek Karpeles and Stephen Balaban hacked on a facial recognition app implementing our own detection algorithm and the excellent recognition backend Face.com (Stephen ended up turning into a company: <a href="http://www.lambdal.com">Lambdal.com</a>) to produce a project for automatically recognizing friends and pulling up their facebook information, just from a picture! All in less than 30 hours! </p>

<p>After the event's judging, we won the San Francisco division! This won us our current laptop and literally 500(!) dollars of <a href="http://www.heroku">Heroku</a> credit.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.firstpost.com/topic/organization/intel-augmented-reality-ar-glasses-app-saving-face-video-F4pgP7IPOqs-830-10.html">I was designated by a reporter at the event to be "last of the freelance hackers"</a>, That's what it says :) .</p>
