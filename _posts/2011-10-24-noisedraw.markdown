This is a demo I was going to present at Assembly 2011, but
I never ended up being able to make it to Sweden. The project
lives on in utter obscurity in the back of <a href="http://www.noisebridge.net">
Noisebridge's</a> solemn 'Member Shelves' corner. I'm not entirely 
emotionally healed here, I really liked
this and put a lot of work into it, as it was my first time working
with a non-x86 ALU on an x86 system (Big endian goes in, little endian
comes out, you can't explain that!). 
<br />
<br />
Since then, the winter has come and gone. The birds are starting to sing again
I cooler and smaller demos with more interesting effects have been written. 
Nevertheless, this is a neat demo of utilizing the lagrangian change instead of 
stochastic branching to achieve performant, small, pretty neato blitter counts.

I guess not all birds are meant to fly :(
