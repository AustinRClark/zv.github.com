<p>This article highlights a recurring dissonance of our postmodern lives - The irony in the paragons of high finance's choice in tools goes against everything that the financial systems are built upon and stand for.</p>

<p>The most advanced algorithms, arguably the most rigourously 'correct' and fastest software was created by what amounts to a bunch of people trying to make something that they thought would be really cool for completely free.</p>

<p>now their 'really cool' software runs the Internet, runs Android, runs Apple's OSX system and will probably run virtually all computers of the future. (Apparently it also runs our financial markets)</p>

<p>Equally interesting is that the businessman's approach to computer software has yielded some of the most hated software companies in the world that invariably implode because of lack of technical competence - Microsoft comes to mind.</p>

<p>What does this say about computer programmers? What does this say about our culture's fierce belief that the pursuit of money is our highest goal, much less that it even matters? </p>

<p>For a culture that lives and breaths the idea that "<i>Communism just can't be right</i>", its strange that we owe practically all our foreign debt to a communist government whose economy is set to surpass our own in less than 4 years, while our information and finance systems run software written by people who wanted nothing less than to destroy the capitalist systems of economics.</p>
