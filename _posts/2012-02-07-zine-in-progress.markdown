<p>Zine In Progress strives to be the definitive src for the Mission District Hack/Phreak scene</p>

<p>Published out of the Noisebridge hackerspace collective, the idea was first concieved over late night hacking between myself and Tony LeTigre<p>

<p>Tony LeTigre operates as the editor at large, while I have been unfortunately designated as "Lord of the Dance/Technical Editor"</p>

<p>After a lot of extremely hard work to put together the issues, following a resounding success and praise for extremely high quality of social and technical commentary -- ZiP is carried today in bookstores and zine publication collations around San Francisco, speaking for a disaffected generation of makers, phreaks and and anyone who lives under the pithy slogan "hack the pl8"</p>

<p><a href="http://zine.noisebridge.net/zip/chapter1">ZiP Issue One "Wanderlust"</a></p>
<p><a href="http://zine.noisebridge.net/zip">Zip Issue Two "Anarchy Enema"</a></p>
