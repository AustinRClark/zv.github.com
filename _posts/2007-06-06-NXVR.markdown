<p id="text">In my younger years, like many children, I grew attached to a
naive, yet pure ideal. One that they are forced to abandon when they grow
accustomed to the mercilessness of reality, for me, this was my hastily
devised dream of NXVR. Eschewing prior stylistic traditions of the torrent
site genre such as degenerate ranting and poorly masquering Trojan downloads.
NXVR was made of a softer, gentler kind of illegally downloadable content.
Probing and ponderous philosophical texts, commercially fruitless cult classics
and acclaimed relics of a bygone era.

Unfortunately, as they say, all good copyright crimes have to come to an end.
The site was later taken down by some surely well meaning DMCA requests. <br>
Perhaps, you'll be able to cry tears and how marvelously naive this whole ideal
of sharing the elements of the meaning of the human experience was. Art costs
money.
