<p id="text">Eschewing the then contemporary stylistic traditions of the torrent
site genre such as degenerate ranting about the moral legitimacy of internet piracy, pornographic ads
and poorly disguised Trojan downloads.
NXVR was made of a softer, gentler kind of downloadable content.
Housed with troves of probing and ponderous philosophical texts, commercially fruitless cult classics
and acclaimed relics of the past.

The site was later taken down by my host after some surely well meaning DMCA requests.
