  description: This is the tree you (should be) seeing now! This tree is algorithmically generated <i>without</i> any sort of base texture and modeled off of Inconvergent Trees, the outline is generated from a modified L-System and the shading from a stochastic Thue system, you can find both it's source and formal description in the repo.

- name: otp
  description: I've written features, fixed bugs and plenty inbetween for Erlang/OTP. I've worked on a <a href="https://klee.github.io/">KLEE</a> script that found <a href="https://github.com/erlang/otp/pull/1108">several</a> <a href="https://github.com/erlang/otp/pull/1111">exploitable</a> <a href="http://erlang.org/pipermail/erlang-questions/2016-February/0875733.html">bugs</a> as well as a custom inprocess fuzzer using <a href="http://llvm.org/docs/LibFuzzer.html">clang's fuzzing framework</a> to fuzz EPMD and the term decoding libraries. It's not all just vulnerability hunting however, I wrote a patch that permits a user to use ecdsa keys to authenticate an Erlang node rather than a single shared cookie or password.

- name: NXVR
  description: Eschewing the stylistic traditions of the torrent site genre; degenerate ranting about the moral legitimacy of internet piracy, pornographic ads and poorly disguised Trojan downloads. NXVR was made of a softer, gentler kind of downloadable content. Housed with troves of probing and ponderous philosophical texts, commercially fruitless cult classics and acclaimed relics of the past. The man later shut me down.
  
- name: Swiftcrack
  description: My first open source project complete with embarrasing mistakes and terrifically bad code! This uses patched WUSB54GS drivers and h1kar1s excellent `chop-chop` package to make one of the very first WEP crackers for Windows. Surprisingly, it lives on despite the presence of considerably more advanced tools like aircrack.
