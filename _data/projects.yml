- name: NXVR
  description: Eschewing the then contemporary stylistic traditions of the torrent site genre such as degenerate ranting about the moral legitimacy of internet piracy, pornographic ads and poorly disguised Trojan downloads.

- name: Swiftcrack
  description: My first open source project, replete with embarrasing mistakes that remind me how much I've grown since 14! This uses patched WUSB54GS drivers and h1kar1s excellent `chop-chop` package to make one of the very first WEP crackers for Windows. Surprisingly, it lives on despite the presence of considerably more advanced tools like aircrack.
