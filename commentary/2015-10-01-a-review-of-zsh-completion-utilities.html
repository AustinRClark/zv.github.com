In 2007, ZSH started to experience some real growth . Increasingly rabid
IRC-based advocacy had finally stirred many into dissatisfaction with the
comparatively inflexible tab-completion system of bash; one of the many new
users was me.
</p>

<p>
Despite it's rather rogue and maverick status amongst shells at the time (if I
may flatter myself) switching was largely painless and ZSH has grown into it's
own as a powerful shell with a developer community of intelligent and thoughtful
hackers, subsequently rising to the status of the vogue choice of programmers
everywhere.
</p>

<p>
One thing that many new users of zsh found initially appealing was ZSH's lengthy
and exceptionally comprehensive documentation; famous for it's enumeration of
details and digressions that involve extensive use of man page 'end notes' (some
of which themselves have manpage 'footnotes') occassionally even describing
features or modules of zsh that never existed.
</p>

<p>
ZSH's creator, Peter Stephenson is largely responsible for this possibly great
documentation, but, like most of us who set out to change the world of
programming, he found it difficult to manage his own programs.
</p>

<p>
As ZSH and it's completion system became more sophisticated, the documentation
began to become one of the largest source of question marks on zsh-user, a
phenomenon that all FOSS developers no doubt been tragically intimate with.
</p>

<p>
ZSH completion documentation has the unique distinction of supporting a wide
range of interpretations and has the potential to generate critical theory
literature for years. Eschewing logical development or programming examples,
reading the completion system or widget documentation begins for most readers as
a science but quickly devolves into a mutated site-function guess-and-check.
</p>

I will not be addressing any of the following:

<li>How to set up completion and associated zstyles</li>
<li>Naming convention (e.g _binary)</li>
<li>Adding completion</li>

A common scenario that occurs in commands such as <i>libcap</i>'s capability
manipulation toolchain, <i>bintools</i> and <i>coreutils</i> is the requirement to
complete a list of arbitrary keywords and then a terminating unix-style option.
